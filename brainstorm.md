## Activity 1. App Idea Brainstorming

### Step 1: Generate new ideas

- Dallas Mavericks Fan app
    - Track scores and stats for Mavs players
- Daily Habit tracker 
    - Can add 3-4 habits and you can track them with the app to see how consistent you are
- Journal app
    - Calendar UI, where user can add a journal entry for each day. Maybe a mood status feature would be cool to look at. 
- Perfume/Cologne App
    - Journal like app that allows user to choose a cologne or perfume based on a particular mood that they are going for

### Step 2: Evaluating App Ideas

#### Top 2:
- Daily Habit Tracker
    - **Description**: Allows users to add habits and track them to see how consistently they are doing them. 
    - **Category**: Productivity
    - **Mobile**: Mobile allows user to instantly enter in their habits and can recieve notifciations as gentle reminders to complete their goals 
    - **Story**: Users can post their progress and share it with their friends and family
    - **Market**: Any user of any age who is seeking to start or maintain a habit
    - **Habit**: Users will check in daily to mark if they stuck with their habit that day
    - **Scope**: Should be rather straight forward in its implementation. Just need a design to note daily progress on a habit.
- Cologne Finder
    - **Description**: User will enter in a mood they are looking for, and colognes that match the mood will display with links for more information. 
    - **Category**: Lifestyle
    - **Mobile**: User can easily open application and view colognes in a list view, making it very readable
    - **Story**: Consumers are usually stuck when it comes to finding a cologne with how many options there are so this app will help reduce how much time they need to spend looking by refining their options based on their preferences like price, mood, reviews, etc. 
    - **Market**: Anyone in the market for a new cologne
    - **Habit**: Not necessarily an app a user will check daily, but the app still provides immense value
    - **Scope**: Can start with basic functionality. User will look for a catgory and then there will be a new view with a list of colognes that match the criteria.

### The final decision
